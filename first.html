<h2>My First Article About Blogging</h2>
<p>I published my first article about business blogging in August, 2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later. The Corporate Bloggging Book was published in 2006. The updated digital edition (with a new preface, a new section on Twitter and much more) is now available on Amazon Kindle. I’ve traveled to China and Dubai and Paris and London and Montreal and many places in between – most recently to Sydney – to convince marketers and executives that corporate blogging is not a passing fad.</p>
<p>Surprisingly perhaps, change has been slow. Many companies are still leery of launching a blog as a way to communicate directly with customers. The talk is now of Facebook and Twitter; yet the concept is the same: open the gates, come down from the mountain and listen, really listen, to your customers and let them talk back to you – even if it’s not what you want to hear.</p>
<p>Click here to read To Blog or Not to Blog… That’s a Good Question, which was published in ClickZ on Aug. 22, 2001. My friend Ann Handley, now chief content officer of MarketingProfs, was the editor.</p>
